# Loan-Eligibilty-Prediction
Predicting whether or not a customer is eligible for a loan using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm (Decision Trees and Naive Bayes Classifier). As a result, the loan prediction machine learning model can be used to assess a customer's loan status and build strategies.

Loan Eligiblity Process is a very lengthy and cumbersome process and requires a lot of man hours therfore to reduce the time and automate this process I have created a Machine Learning Algorithm using Supervised Learning. We have first checked that which algorithm gives us the most accuracy out of Decison Trees, Naives Bayes Classifier and Support Vector Machine and then have implemented the project.
I have perfomed various techniques in this algorithms such as: Importing Libraries and Data, Exploratory Data analysis, Scaling and fitting the data, Training data, Accuracy of Data and then have perfomed this on the test dataset.
